      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve recently started an effort to learn more about operating systems, particularly Unix-like systems. To start with, I am using the online book xv6: a simple, Unix-like teaching operating system, along with the code available on GitHub. As the name suggests, xv6 is a minimal operating system, based on Unix (as are many other real-world operating systems today), designed for teaching and learning. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t include many of the key capabilities you would expect in a production-grade OS, but the foundational capabilities of an OS kernel are there.</description>
