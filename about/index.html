Practicing the craft of systems software.
Hello! &#x1f44b; I&rsquo;m Nick - a systems engineer who explores the intersection of operating systems, networking, compilers, and distributed systems. I&rsquo;m drawn to the parts of computing where ideas meet machinery - where correctness, clarity, and performance all have to coexist.
I think of myself as a Systems Toolsmith: someone who learns by building, who refines their understanding through experiments, and who aims to leave behind tools and explanations that make systems a little more comprehensible to others. Most of my projects start as small explorations - questions about how something really works beneath the abstractions - and often grow into tools or notes that I publish here.">

<p>Hello! &#x1f44b; I&rsquo;m Nick - a systems engineer who explores the intersection of operating systems, networking, compilers, and distributed systems. I&rsquo;m drawn to the parts of computing where ideas meet machinery - where correctness, clarity, and performance all have to coexist.</p>
<p>I think of myself as a <strong>Systems Toolsmith</strong>: someone who learns by building, who refines their understanding through experiments, and who aims to leave behind tools and explanations that make systems a little more comprehensible to others. Most of my projects start as small explorations - questions about how something <em>really</em> works beneath the abstractions - and often grow into tools or notes that I publish here.</p>
<p>I care about software that teaches as much as it executes. Code, when written with care, can double as an explanation - a kind of executable essay about how a system should behave. My focus is on building systems that are not only reliable, but also understandable by the engineers who maintain them.</p>
<p>This site is my working notebook: lab reports, experiments, and reflections from my study of systems software. Some posts are deep dives into system internals; others are short notes that capture a question I&rsquo;m exploring that week.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re also interested in the craft of building and understanding reliable systems, I&rsquo;d love for you to read along - or better yet, reach out and compare notes. You can find me on <a href="https://github.com/nwchandler/"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub</a> or <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nickchandler/"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LinkedIn</a> if you&rsquo;d like to connect.</p>
