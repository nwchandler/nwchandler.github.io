      <description>As a software engineer, have you ever faced a complex project where every task seems to depend on another? My team at HashiCorp ran into just that — and found a method that helped us tackle those interdependencies in a way that lets us make smooth progress.

      <description>In the previous post, I described why I&amp;rsquo;m writing a small Unix shell, which I&amp;rsquo;m calling wishr, along with a bit of an overview of how I plan to approach the project. I&amp;rsquo;m excited to get started on the shell, itself, but it&amp;rsquo;s important to get a new repo set up for success. So, in this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll go through the initial repository setup I&amp;rsquo;ve gone with.&#xA;If you&amp;rsquo;d like to look at the specific git commit, here it is!</description>

      <description>This is the first post in a series where I plan to document my experience writing a small Unix shell in Rust called wishr. In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll describe why I&amp;rsquo;m starting this project and how I plan to proceed through it.&#xA;Why write a shell? Link to heading First off, to be clear, I have no intention to make a production quality shell: Bash, Z Shell, fish, and the like, can all breathe a sigh of relief here!</description>

      <description>Hello! &amp;#x1f44b;&#xA;My name is Nick, and I&amp;rsquo;m a software engineer in Indiana (in the United States). I focus on backend, behind-the-scenes, software; if I am making a UI, it is probably a CLI. &amp;#x1f604;&#xA;I enjoy learning about computer systems and software, and on this site, I hope to post occasionally about interesting things I learn as well as personal projects I work on.</description>
