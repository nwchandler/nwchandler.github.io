      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve recently started an effort to learn more about operating systems, particularly Unix-like systems. Modern operating systems offer a lot of incredible capabilities for application programmers, and they can even provide unique ways of delivering applications. For example, containers are largely possible because of Linux capabilities such as namespaces and cgroups. However, I would like to spend some time digging into the foundations of operating systems so that I have a better framework with which to explore some of these unique, modern capabilities.</description>
